# Stewart

Stewart is a minimalist, high-performance, and non-exclusive actor system.

- Minimalist: Starts from a small self-contained and thread-local actor system with minimal
    assumptions. Everything else is built on top, including threading!
- High-Performance: Built around real-time rendering use cases. Fearlessly use stewart for
    anything!
- Non-Exclusive: Plays nicely with other actor systems, async runtimes, web-workers, GPU pipelines,
    distributed frameworks, etc... Stewart doesn't limit what you can interact with.
